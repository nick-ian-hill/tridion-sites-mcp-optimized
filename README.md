# Tridion Sites MCP Server

This repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to integrate Tridion Sites with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot and Gemini CLI. By running this server, you transform your AI assistant into a BluePrint-aware collaborator capable of navigating complex content hierarchies, executing system administration tasks, and orchestrating batch operations via the Tridion Sites Core Service REST API.

## Optimized Architecture: Meta-Tools

Unlike traditional MCP servers that expose every tool in the system prompt (which can consume thousands of tokens), this server uses a **discovery-based architecture** consisting of two specialized "Meta-Tools":

1.  **`getToolDetails`**: Allows the AI assistant to browse a lightweight summary of all 83 tools and "fetch" the full documentation and JSON schema for only the tools it needs for the current task.
2.  **`callTool`**: A single, validated execution point for all CMS operations.

This approach is an independent implementation of the **MCP Compression** pattern (referenced by Atlassian in [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/mcp-compression-preventing-tool-bloat-in-ai-agents)), which ensures the system prompt stays small and efficient, leaving more room in the context window for actual content and reasoning.

### Mandatory Tool Access Protocol (Discovery-First Handshake)

To ensure operational safety and context accuracy, this server enforces a **Discovery-First Handshake** protocol. AI agents cannot execute tools based on guesswork or historical knowledge.

1.  **Handshake Requirement**: Before any tool can be executed via `callTool`, the agent **MUST** first call `getToolDetails` for that specific tool.
2.  **Access GUID**: The `getToolDetails` response includes a unique, deterministic **Access GUID** for the requested tool.
3.  **Validated Execution**: The `callTool` function requires this `accessGuid` as a mandatory parameter. If the GUID is missing or incorrect, the execution is rejected.

This protocol ensures that the AI assistant always reviews the JSON schema, business rules, and "Heuristics" provided in the tool's extended description before attempting a mutation, significantly reducing the risk of hallucinations or invalid CMS operations.


## Capabilities

This server exposes over 80 tools covering all major areas of Tridion Sites content management. The table below summarises what the AI assistant can do on your behalf once connected.

| Domain | Available Operations |
|---|---|
| **Content Discovery** | Search items; retrieve full item details and version history; browse container contents; inspect dependency graphs, publish info, and lock status |
| **Content Creation** | Create components, pages, publications, structure groups, and multimedia components (from a URL, base64 data, file attachment, or an AI-generated prompt) |
| **Content Editing** | Update component content, page layouts, item properties, metadata, and publication settings |
| **Content Organization** | Copy or move items between containers within a publication; delete items or specific historical versions |
| **Schema Management** | Create and modify component, embedded, metadata, bundle, multimedia, and region schemas |
| **Version Control** | Check out / in items, undo checkouts, and roll back to prior versions |
| **Publishing** | Publish and unpublish items to configured targets; monitor and query publish transactions |
| **Workflow** | Start, assign, finish, and restart individual workflow activities; force-finish or revert entire workflow process instances; manage process definitions and approval statuses |
| **Taxonomy & Classification** | Classify items with keywords, browse category trees, and auto-classify items or multimedia components using AI |
| **BluePrint & Localization** | Visualize and create BluePrint hierarchies; localize and unlocalize items; promote and demote items to parent or child publications |
| **Multimedia** | Read binary content and split Word / PowerPoint documents into structured components and images |
| **User Management** | Retrieve and update user profiles; list CMS users |
| **AI-Powered Generation** | Generate component content, create or update multimedia from natural language prompts *(requires a configured Gemini API key)* |
| **Orchestration** | Execute complex multi-step operations via the `toolOrchestrator`, which runs sandboxed scripts with access to all other tools — enabling conditional logic, loops, and batch processing |

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
* Access to a Tridion Sites CMS instance

---

## 1. Local Server Setup

To get the MCP server running on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download/Clone the repository:** Ensure you have the latest version of the codebase on your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Obtain Service Account Credentials:**
   To authenticate the server against the CM REST API, you need a valid Client ID and Secret.
   * Log in to your Tridion Sites **Access Management** console.
   * Navigate to the **Service accounts** tab.
   * Locate and click on the relevant service account for your environment (e.g., **Tridion Sites Content Manager API Client (admin)**).
   * From the details screen, copy your **Client ID** and generate/copy your **Client Secret**.

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Set the following environment variables using the credentials you just obtained.
   *(Note: The URLs below are examples and should be updated to match your target CMS environment).*

   ```env
   CORE_API_URL=http://your-cms-host/api/v3.0
   AUTH_TOKEN_URL=http://your-auth-host/access-management/connect/token
   AUTH_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
   AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
   ```

   > **Note on `GEMINI_API_KEY`:** This key is only required if you intend to use the AI-powered tools (`autoClassifyItem`, `autoClassifyMultimediaComponent`, `generateContentFromPrompt`, `createMultimediaComponentFromPrompt`, `updateMultimediaComponentFromPrompt`). It is also required by `readMultimediaComponent` and `readUploadedFile` when reading **image** files (the vision model is used to analyse the image content; non-image formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF do not require the key). All other tools work without it. Obtain a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

   > **Windows tip:** To set variables persistently (so they survive terminal sessions and reboots), use **System Properties** instead of setting them in the terminal:
   > 1. Open **Start**, search for **"Edit the system environment variables"**, and open it.
   > 2. Click **Environment Variables…** and add each variable under **User variables**.
   > 3. Click **OK** on all dialogs, then open a **new terminal** before continuing.
   >
   > Alternatively, set them temporarily in PowerShell for the current session:
   > ```powershell
   > $env:CORE_API_URL = "http://..."
   > $env:AUTH_TOKEN_URL = "http://..."
   > $env:AUTH_CLIENT_ID = "<your-client-id>"
   > $env:AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = "<your-client-secret>"
   > ```

5. **Start the server:**
   
   The server automatically detects the correct transport mode.

   **Standard Mode (Stdio):**
   Automatically used when the server is launched by an AI agent (Gemini CLI, Claude, VS Code). To force this mode in a terminal for testing:
   ```bash
   npm run start:stdio
   ```

   **Streamable HTTP Mode:**
   Automatically used when the server is run directly in a terminal for manual testing:
   ```bash
   npm run start:http
   ```
   *(Note: You can also just run `npm start`; it will automatically detect the interactive terminal and default to HTTP).*

    **Configuration Toggles:**
    You can toggle features via CLI flags, environment variables, or a local `.env` file. When using `npm start`, remember to use the `--` separator to pass flags through to the underlying process:

    *   **Tool Parameter Inclusion (Default: Enabled)**
        By default, the `getToolDetails` summary includes a comma-separated list of top-level arguments for every tool. This helps the AI assistant identify the correct tool more accurately before fetching full details.
        *   Disable: `npm start -- --no-params` or `MCP_INCLUDE_PARAMETERS=false`
        *   Enable: `npm start -- --with-params` or `MCP_INCLUDE_PARAMETERS=true`

    *   **Transport Mode Override**
        *   Force HTTP: `npm start -- --http` or `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`
        *   Force Stdio: `npm start -- --stdio` or `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`

## 3. Integration Examples

The Tridion Sites MCP server can be integrated into various AI environments. Each environment supports both **Stdio** (local subprocess) and **HTTP** (network service) transports.

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot)
VS Code uses an `mcp.json` file (either globally in your user profile or locally in a `.vscode/` folder).

#### Stdio Mode (Process)
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tridion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/absolute/path/to/src/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "CORE_API_URL": "...",
        "AUTH_CLIENT_ID": "...",
        "AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "...",
        "AUTH_TOKEN_URL": "...",
        "MCP_INCLUDE_PARAMETERS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Mode (Streamable)
Ensure the server is running locally first (`npm start`).
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tridion": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8090"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Gemini CLI
Gemini CLI uses a `settings.json` file to register MCP servers.
Note: you may need to use absolute paths for the command arguments.

#### Stdio Mode (Process)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tridion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "tsx",
        "/Users/YOUR_USER/path/to/src/index.ts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CORE_API_URL": "...",
        "AUTH_CLIENT_ID": "...",
        "MCP_INCLUDE_PARAMETERS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Mode (Streamable)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tridion": {
      "httpUrl": "http://localhost:8090"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Google Antigravity
Antigravity uses an `mcp_config.json` file.

#### Stdio Mode (Process)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tridion": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "--import",
        "/Users/YOUR_USER/path/to/node_modules/tsx/dist/loader.mjs",
        "/Users/YOUR_USER/path/to/src/index.ts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CORE_API_URL": "...",
        "AUTH_CLIENT_ID": "...",
        "MCP_INCLUDE_PARAMETERS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Mode (Streamable)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tridion": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8090"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Development & Testing (Mock Server)

This repository includes a standalone **Tridion Mock Server** (`tridion-mock-server.js`) that allows you to develop and test MCP tool configurations without requiring a live Tridion Sites environment.

### Starting the Mock Server

To launch the mock server on your local machine:

```bash
node tridion-mock-server.js 8081
```

Once started, the mock server provides a simulated CM REST API and Access Management endpoint at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Mock Server Configuration

To point your MCP server at the mock instance, use the following environment variable configuration in your `mcp.json` or `.env` file:

```json
"env": {
    "CORE_API_URL": "http://localhost:8081/api/v3.0",
    "AUTH_TOKEN_URL": "http://localhost:8081/access-management/connect/token",
    "MCP_INCLUDE_PARAMETERS": "true",
    "AUTH_CLIENT_ID": "any-id",
    "AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "any-secret"
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The mock server is stateless and accepts any Client ID/Secret. It is pre-seeded with a basic BluePrint hierarchy (System Master, Content Master, Website EN) and several common schemas (Article, Address, etc.) to facilitate immediate tool testing.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### "Connection closed" or "Disconnected" in Stdio Mode
If the server fails to connect in Gemini CLI or Claude Desktop ensure the path to `src/index.ts` in your config is absolute (e.g., `/Users/name/...`). Relative paths often fail because the CLI launches from its own application directory.

### The AI Assistant returns an `invalid_client` authentication error
If the MCP server is running but the assistant reports that calls to the CMS are failing with an `invalid_client` error, the Tridion authentication server is rejecting your credentials. Check the following:

1. **VS Code Stale Terminals (Most Common):** If you recently set or updated your environment variables locally, **any currently open VS Code terminals will not see the new values**. 
   * **Fix:** You must completely kill the terminal session by clicking the **Trash Can icon** in the terminal panel, open a new terminal, and run `npm run start` again.
   * **Verify:** In your new VS Code terminal, you can verify the variable was picked up by running:
     * *PowerShell:* `echo $env:AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
     * *Bash/Zsh:* `echo $AUTH_CLIENT_ID`

2. **Old or Revoked Credentials:** Ensure you are using the correct secret for the specific environment URL (`AUTH_TOKEN_URL`) you are targeting. If you are copying a secret shared by a colleague, it may have been regenerated or revoked in Access Management. Generate a fresh secret if necessary.

---

### The server fails to start: `EADDRINUSE` (port already in use)

If `npm start` exits immediately with an `EADDRINUSE` error, another process is already using port 8090 (often a previous server instance that was not cleanly stopped).

* **Kill the conflicting process** (PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8090).OwningProcess | Stop-Process
  ```
* Then re-run `npm run start`.

---

### The AI assistant reports it cannot reach the CMS (network/timeout errors)

1. Confirm the CMS is reachable from your machine by opening `CORE_API_URL` in a browser or running:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $env:CORE_API_URL -UseBasicParsing
   ```
2. Check that no VPN, firewall, or proxy is blocking outbound HTTP requests to the CMS host.
3. If you are targeting a CMS on a private network, ensure your machine is connected to the appropriate VPN or internal network.

---

### Tools are missing or not visible in the AI assistant

* **GitHub Copilot:** The connection is established automatically when you ask a question that requires the MCP tools — no manual action is needed. If the tools are still not available, open the `mcp.json` file and click **Restart** in the CodeLens overlay. Note that this button only reconnects VS Code to the server; which must already be running (`npm run start`) for it to succeed.
* **Gemini CLI:** After saving changes to `settings.json`, restart the Gemini application completely. Run `/mcp list` in the chat to confirm the server is connected.

---

### Gemini CLI shows the MCP server as "disconnected"

Gemini CLI attempts to connect to all configured MCP servers **once at startup**. If the server was not running at the time the CLI was launched, the connection fails for that session.

**Fix:** Start `npm start` first and then launch Gemini CLI, or — if the CLI is already open — start the server and then run `/mcp reload` in the Gemini CLI chat to reconnect without restarting.
